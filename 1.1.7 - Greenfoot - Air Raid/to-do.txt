TO-DO LIST:

> Object creation. Done.
> Grid-locking. Use XYToGrid and GridToXY. Done.
> Create out-of-bounds system. Done.
> Create target objects.
> Fleet stacking. Detect if there are two objects in one grid.
> Fleet display. Displays the currently selected fleet by using objects.
> Movement animation. Points at target location then moves in a total of 6 frames.

NOTE:

> Fleet system may be abandoned and changed to no-stack system. Detects if target location has object. If so, cant move, if no, then move. See https://www.greenfoot.org/topics/57836/0 for more info.
> May need mathematical triangulation to determine vectors.

POSSIBLE ADDITIONS:

> Resolution settings.
